Anonymous@Arb/p15 (https://github.com/p15-git-acc) has written quite computationally efficient codes using the Arb library, for different aspects of the dbn upper bound project.
To make them easier to find, links to them are documented below.

Updated C code (needs the arb library from arblib.org) to compute H or its derivative, implementing the third approach for derivative bounds:
