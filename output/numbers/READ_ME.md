# These files were generated using an early version of the code used to find
# zeroes of H_t. The naming convention is as follows: "output_a_b_c_d" refers
# to the output of H_t_probable_1000_zeros.py upon entry of l=a k=b and j in
# range c to d.

# Edit: Files added on/after 29 January 2018 should be calculated using the
# version of the python code from at least 28 January 2018.
