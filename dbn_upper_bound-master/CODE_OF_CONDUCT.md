# Polymath15 Code of Conduct (taken from Google Tensorflow)

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers 
pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for 
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, 
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in which it occurs. 

All Polymath15 forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which 
could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.
